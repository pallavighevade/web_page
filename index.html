        A Aa revolves around the lives of 23-year-old Anasuya Ramalingam and Aanand Vihari and their families. Aanand, a
        former chef, runs an e-foods business in Hyderabad. He belongs to a middle-class family with responsibilities to
        fulfill, like getting his sister Bhanumathi married and paying off debts (his father is dead).

        Anasuya is the daughter of a rich and strict mother named Mahalakshmi. Anasuya has never really got along with
        her mother, while being very close to her father, Ramalingam, who doesn't talk much against Mahalakshmi. When
        her mother goes on a business trip, her father Ramalingam sends her to visit her extended family in Kalavapudi
        village near Vijayawada to avoid a matchmaking for her. On the train ride there, she meets her cousin Aanand,
        whom her father asked to accompany her back to his home.

        publications such as Paste and Film Companion. Several publications such as O, The Oprah Magazine[12] and
        Cosmopolitan have named it as one of the best films of Indian Cinema.[13][12] Shubhra Gupta from The Indian
        Express named Queen as one of India's 75 most iconic and finest films that celebrate the journey of the
        country.[14][15] British Film Institute ranked Queen amongst the 10 greatest Bollywood films of the 21st
